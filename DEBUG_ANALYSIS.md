# Debug Analysis - Teams Transcription App

## Date: July 16, 2025

## Summary
The application builds and runs successfully but transcription is not working due to missing speech recognition API credentials.

## Key Findings

### 1. Build Environment ✅
- Visual Studio 2022 Community: Installed and working
- CMake: Version 4.1.0-rc1 installed
- vcpkg: Installed at C:\vcpkg
- nlohmann/json: Properly installed via vcpkg

### 2. Application Startup ✅
- Application launches successfully
- Configuration system works properly
- Audio capture initializes (using Windows WASAPI loopback)
- UI components load correctly
- Debug logging system functions as designed

### 3. Transcription Failure ❌
**Root Cause**: Speech recognition provider initialization fails

**Specific Issues**:
1. Azure Speech provider selected by default (provider: 0)
2. No API key configured in settings.json
3. Azure provider fails to initialize without API key
4. No fallback mechanism to try other providers

### 4. Debug Log Analysis
```
2025-07-16 10:02:03 [CONFIG] [API Key] = EMPTY
2025-07-16 10:02:04 [INFO] Created Azure speech provider, initializing...
2025-07-16 10:02:04 [ERROR] Failed to initialize Azure speech provider
2025-07-16 10:02:04 [WARN] No speech provider available when setting transcription callback
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix Options

1. **Use Windows Speech Recognition** (No API key required)
   - Edit `config/settings.json`
   - Change `"provider": "azure"` to `"provider": "windows"`
   - This uses the built-in Windows speech recognition

2. **Add Azure Credentials** (If available)
   - Edit `config/settings.json`
   - Add your Azure Speech API key to `"apiKey": ""`
   - Set appropriate `"region": "eastus"` (or your region)

3. **Implement Provider Fallback**
   - Modify SpeechRecognition.cpp
   - Add logic to try Windows provider when Azure fails
   - This provides better user experience

### Configuration File Location
`build/output/Debug/config/settings.json`

## Next Steps

1. Choose a speech provider approach (Windows or Azure)
2. Update configuration accordingly
3. Test transcription functionality
4. Add provider fallback logic for robustness
5. Update documentation with setup instructions

## Technical Details

- Audio capture format: 16kHz sample rate (configured)
- Speech providers implemented: Azure, OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Windows
- Current provider enum values:
  - 0: Azure
  - 1: OpenAI  
  - 2: AzureOpenAI
  - 3: Windows
