## üìù Development Notes

### Key Insights Discovered:
1. **Audio Pipeline Always Worked**: Initial user perception of "broken" pipeline was due to GUI display issues
2. **Debug Log vs GUI Separation**: File logging working correctly, GUI panel needed integration
3. **Dynamic Layout Complexity**: Windows API requires manual resize handling for responsive design
4. **Provider Abstraction Benefits**: Easy switching between speech recognition providers
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: JSON-based settings enable easy development iteration

### Code Quality Improvements:
- Comprehensive logging throughout audio pipeline
- Proper error handling in critical paths
- Clean separation of concerns between components
- Consistent naming conventions and documentation
- Robust configuration validation

### Performance Characteristics:
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient audio buffering with configurable limits
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal overhead for audio capture and processing
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times for audio forwarding
- **GUI Responsiveness**: Smooth resizing and update operations

## üéØ Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (High Priority):
1. **Implement Azure OpenAI HTTP Calls**: Replace stub with real API integration
2. **Test Real Transcription**: Validate end-to-end speech recognition
3. **Polish Export Features**: Complete transcription export functionality
4. **Production Testing**: Test with actual Teams meetings

### Future Enhancements (Medium Priority):
1. **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust recovery from API failures
2. **Performance Optimization**: Buffer management and throughput tuning
3. **User Experience**: Enhanced GUI features and usability
