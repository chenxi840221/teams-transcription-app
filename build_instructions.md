# Build Status and Next Steps

## Issue Fixed
The string concatenation error in MainWindow.cpp line 129 has been resolved by ensuring both sides of the ternary operator return std::string objects.

**Before (causing error):**
```cpp
CONFIG_LOG("API Key", config.speechConfig.apiKey.empty() ? "EMPTY" : "SET (" + std::to_string(config.speechConfig.apiKey.length()) + " chars)");
```

**After (fixed):**
```cpp
CONFIG_LOG("API Key", config.speechConfig.apiKey.empty() ? std::string("EMPTY") : std::string("SET (") + std::to_string(config.speechConfig.apiKey.length()) + " chars)");
```

## To Build and Test:

1. Open **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022**
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\workspace\transcriptor\TeamsTranscriptionApp
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```cmd
   cmake --build build --config Debug
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```cmd
   build\output\Debug\TeamsTranscriptionApp.exe
   ```

## Expected Results:
- Application should compile successfully 
- Comprehensive logging will be enabled throughout the audio pipeline
- Debug information will be written to `debug.log`
- Audio samples will be processed and logged for troubleshooting
- Azure OpenAI transcription should work with the configured endpoint

## Debug Features Added:
- ✅ Audio capture logging with detailed format information
- ✅ Speech recognition provider initialization logging  
- ✅ Transcription callback logging
- ✅ Pipeline flow tracking from audio capture to UI display
- ✅ Azure OpenAI provider with WAV file creation
- ✅ Configuration validation logging

The comprehensive logging system will help identify exactly where in the pipeline the transcription process might be failing.
