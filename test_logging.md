# Enhanced Debug Logging Implementation

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented comprehensive logging throughout the audio transcription pipeline to help debug why transcription isn't working. Here's what was added:

### 1. DebugLogger Framework (Already Complete)
- **File**: `src/DebugLogger.h`
- **Features**:
  - Timestamped log entries with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  - Both console and file output
  - Audio data logging with size and format information
  - Configuration logging
  - Local audio sample saving for debugging
  - Convenience macros: `DEBUG_LOG()`, `INFO_LOG()`, `WARN_LOG()`, `ERROR_LOG()`, `AUDIO_LOG()`, `CONFIG_LOG()`

### 2. MainWindow.cpp Logging
- **ProcessAudioData()**: 
  - Logs every audio data callback with size and format details
  - Saves audio samples every 50 calls for debugging
  - Warns when audio processing is skipped (paused or no speech recognition)
  - Tracks total call count
- **UpdateTranscription()**: 
  - Logs all transcription updates with text and confidence
  - Warns when empty text is received
  - Logs UI update success/failure
- **InitializeComponents()**: 
  - Logs configuration loading status
  - Logs provider, API key status, endpoint, and language
  - Logs component initialization success/failure

### 3. SpeechRecognition.cpp Logging
- **All Providers Enhanced**:
  - **AzureSpeechProvider**: Logs audio buffer accumulation, processing triggers, and callback execution
  - **AzureOpenAISpeechProvider**: Detailed logging of 3-second audio chunks, WAV file creation, and transcription attempts
  - **WindowsSpeechProvider**: Complete demo transcription logging for pipeline testing
- **Main SpeechRecognition Class**:
  - Logs provider initialization with detailed provider type and configuration
  - Tracks audio data forwarding to providers
  - Logs transcription callback setup
  - Warning system for uninitialized state

### 4. AudioCapture.cpp Logging
- **StartCapture()**: Logs capture start process and any failures
- **ProcessAudioData()**: 
  - Logs every audio frame with size, frame count, and flags
  - Distinguishes between silent and active audio buffers
  - Tracks callback execution to MainWindow
  - Warns when no callback is set

## Debug Files Created
When you run the application, it will create:
- **`debug.log`**: Main log file with timestamped entries
- **`debug_audio/`** directory containing:
  - `audio_sample_N.raw`: Raw audio samples every 50 calls
  - `azure_openai_wav_N.wav`: WAV files created for Azure OpenAI

## How to Use the Enhanced Logging

1. **Build and run** the application in VS Developer Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   cd build
   cmake --build . --config Debug
   cd output/Debug
   TeamsTranscriptionApp.exe
   ```

2. **Start recording** and play some audio (music, speech, etc.)

3. **Check the debug.log file** to see the complete pipeline flow:
   ```
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [INFO] === TEAMS TRANSCRIPTION APP STARTING ===
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [INFO] Config loaded: SUCCESS
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [INFO] Provider: 4  // 4 = AzureOpenAI
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [INFO] API Key: SET (88 chars)
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [INFO] AudioCapture::StartCapture called
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [DEBUG] AUDIO [AudioCapture] Size: 1920 bytes, Format: Frames: 240, Flags: 0
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [DEBUG] AudioCapture calling audio callback with 1920 bytes
   2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXX [DEBUG] AUDIO [MainWindow] Size: 1920 bytes, Format: Rate: 48000Hz, Channels: 2, Bits: 16
   ```

## Expected Findings

The enhanced logging will help identify:

1. **Audio Capture Issues**: 
   - Is audio being captured from the system?
   - Are the audio parameters correct?
   - Is the callback being triggered?

2. **Provider Configuration**:
   - Which speech provider is actually being used?
   - Are API keys and endpoints properly loaded?
   - Is the provider initializing correctly?

3. **Audio Pipeline Flow**:
   - Is audio data flowing from AudioCapture → MainWindow → SpeechRecognition → Provider?
   - Where in the pipeline is data getting lost?
   - Are callbacks being set up correctly?

4. **Transcription Processing**:
   - Is the provider receiving audio data?
   - Are transcription attempts being made?
   - Is the transcription callback being called?

## Next Steps After Running

Once you run with logging enabled, we can:
1. **Analyze the log** to pinpoint where the pipeline breaks
2. **Examine saved audio samples** to verify audio quality
3. **Fix specific issues** identified in the logs
4. **Implement real Azure OpenAI HTTP requests** if the pipeline is working
